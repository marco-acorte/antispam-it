    I have a simplistic way of doing this by using Message Filters
    via the Tools drop-down.

    Filter Rules

    Filter Name: From Spam (Junk)
    Apply filter when: Checking Mail or Manually Run

    Match any of the following
    From - Isn't in my address book - Collected Addresses
    From - is - my e-Mail Address (i.e xyz@abc.com)

    Perform these actions:
    Set Junk Status to - Junk
    Delete Message

    Everything not in my address book goes to the trash folder which you can spot check to see if you want to add any of those addresses to your Collected Addresses. Once you are sure there is no mail you want to keep or add to you address book, go to Tools and Run filters on folder while in the trash folder and all the junk will be deleted from the trash folder. Occasionally, run a Compact on the trash folder to keep it from getting too big.

    I never see any spam clutter in my Inbox. I have full control of what gets deleted and what doesn't. Even though it is not 100% automated, it works fine for my needs.
